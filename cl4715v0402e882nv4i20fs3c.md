## Difference Between Var ,Let and Const variable in JavaScript

Hello everyone, hope you are all doing well. My name is Surya L, and the aim of this blog is to teach you all about Difference Between Var ,Let and Const variable in JavaScript.

**There are 3 types of Variable declaration.**

- Var

- Let

- Const

## Var:

- 
The var keyword declares a variable globally, or locally if it is declared inside a function.  

- var is function scoped because once declared it can be used throughout the 
function.


- 
Example:
```
var numArray = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  numArray.push(i);
}
console.log(numArray);
console.log(i);
```

- 
The Output of above code is ðŸ‘‡

**[0, 1, 2]**


- The value of **var** variable can be changed through out the function
for example:
```
var a=5;
a=7;
console.log(a);
```

- 
First the value 5 will be assigned to variable a. Then a is assigned with the new value 7.

- **var** is an ECMAScript1 feature.

- Supported browsers are -: Chrome , Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, safari , opera


## Let:

- 
**Let** is a block scoped variable.

- Whenever a **let** variable is declared, it is limited to the block of code in where it is declared.

- let is a feature of **ES6** or **ECMAScrpit2015**.

- Supported browsers are -: Chrome49, Microsoft Edge12, firefox44 , safari11, opera36.

- Once declared the value of the **let** variable cannot be changed unlike **var** variable.
For example:
```
let a=5;
let a=6;
console.log(a);
```
When this code is run we get the error **SyntaxError: Identifier 'a' has already been declared.
**

## Const:


- **Const** variable is also introduced in **ES6** or **ECMAScrpit2015**.

- Once the value of the **Const** variable is determined, it cannot be changed and we would get a error when we try to change the value.

- For example:
```
const a=8;
console.log(a);
```
The Output of above code is ðŸ‘‡

**8**


- If we try to change the value of Const variable we get error
**Assignment to constant variable** in the console.

- For example:
```
const a=8;
a=9;
console.log(a);
```
## Conclusion:

- var is function scoped because once declared it can be used throughout the function.

- Whenever a **let** variable is declared, it is limited to the block of code in where it is declared.

- Once the value of the **Const** variable is determined, it cannot be changed and we would get a error when we try to change the value.
