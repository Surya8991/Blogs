## Compound Assignment with Arithmetic Operation

Hello everyone hope everyone is doing well. My name is Surya L, the purpose of this blog is to teach all about Compound Assignment with Arithmetic Operations.

-  4.Compound Assignment With Augmented Division


## 1.Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition:
Assignments are commonly used to modify the contents of a variable in programming. All things to the right of the equals sign are evaluated first, so we can say

```
myVar = myVar + 5;
//to add 5 to myVar. Since this is such a common pattern, there are operators which do both a mathematical operation and assignment in one step.

//One such operator is the **+= **operator.

let myVar = 1;
myVar += 5;
console.log(myVar);
```
## 2.Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction
Like the **+=** operator above, we can use **-=** subtracts a number from a variable.

```
myVar = myVar - 5;
//will subtract 5 from myVar. This can be rewritten as:

myVar -= 5;
```
## 3.Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication
The** *=** operator multiplies a variable by a number.

```
myVar = myVar * 5;
//will multiply myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

myVar *= 5;
```
## 4.Compound Assignment With Augmented Division
The **/=** operator divides a variable by another number.

```
myVar = myVar / 5;
Will divide myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

myVar /= 5;
```
To Summarize:


- Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition(+=):Adds the value of variable by value given(eg myVar+=5)

-  Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction(-=):Subtract the value of variable by value given(eg myVar-=5)

- Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication(*=)Multiply the value of variable by value given(eg myVar*=5)

-  Compound Assignment With Augmented Division(/=):Divide the value of variable by value given(eg myVar/=5)
