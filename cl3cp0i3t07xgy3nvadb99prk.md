## Arithmetic Operation In JavaScript

This Blog will teach you all about Arithmetic Operations In JavaScript.
## Add Two Numbers with JavaScript:
JavaScript uses the **+** symbol as an addition operator when placed between two numbers.

Example:

```
const myVar = 5 + 10;//Adds 5+10 =15
const sum = 10 + 10;//Adds 10+10 =20
```
## Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript:

JavaScript uses the - symbol for subtraction.

Example

```
const myVar = 12 - 6;//Subtract 12-6=6
const difference = 45 - 33;//Subtract 45-33=12
```
## Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript

JavaScript uses the * symbol for multiplication of two numbers.

Example

```
const myVar = 13 * 13;
//myVar would have the value 169.
const product = 8 * 10;//8*10=80
```
## Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript

JavaScript uses the / symbol for division.

Example

```
const myVar = 16 / 2;//myVar now has the value 8.
const quotient = 66 / 33; //66 divided by 22 = 2
```
## Finding a Remainder in JavaScript

The remainder operator **%** gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

Example

```
5 % 2 = 1 ;
17 % 2 = 1;//(17 is Odd)
48 % 2 = 0;//(48 is Even)
```
