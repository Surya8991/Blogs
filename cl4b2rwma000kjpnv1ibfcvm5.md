Hello everyone, hope you are all doing well. My name is Surya L. This blog is about What is stress/anxiety/Depression and the Magic Pill ðŸ’Š to overcome it.

# **Note:**
- I know that life can be difficult, stressful, and depressing.
- I strongly advise you not to take any hasty decision, such as suicide, which will be a loss for both you and those around you.

## What is StressðŸ˜¨?

- It is a feeling you experience when you are put under pressure by a certain situation or someone else.

## Anxiety:
- Anxiety refers to fearing something or someone or being afraid to do something.

- 
It's your brain's way of responding to stress and alerting you of potential dangers ahead.

## DepressionðŸ˜”:
- 7 out of 10 are depressed.
- Most people in this world are depressed due to a variety of factors, including career, family, marriage, unemployment, and work stress.

## Reasons for Stress/Anxiety/Depression:

- 
### Work Stress:
Every day at work, we are stressed as a result of the pressure put on us by higher officials.

- ### Unemployment:
Stress/Anxiety/Depression may be caused by lack of employment during student education or by losing one's job.

- ### Lack of Satisfaction in Life by Work, Family etc.

- ### Money

- ### Overthinking:
Overthinking is a slow poison that can destroy our lives if not cured in time.

- 
### Doing things at the last minute.

- ### Lack of Sleep:
Even if it seems simple or confusing, sleep really matters.
Sleep is the best stress reliever out of all options.
A good night's sleep will help you think more clearly.


- ### Comparing yourself with others.

# How to fix this:


### 1.Just a take 10min break in your life and think what's happening around you.

### **2.Don't Ever Compare yourself with others:**

- 
Just as each finger on the hand is different, each of us humans is different and has his or her own strength and dream, so explore them all.

### **3.Have a good Sleep:**
- You probably know that even when the computer hangs or is stuck, everyone would restart or shut down the computer and turn it back on.
- We humans need at least 7 to 8 hours of sleep a day for us to feel refreshed, motivated, and to accomplish our tasks.

###  **4.Work Stress**:
- Approximately 80% of people get their stress from their job.
- Even though a job can be stressful day in and day out, we accomplish daily targets and goals.
- Try not to overthink, and keep your stress to work hours only.
- At the end of the day, it's just a job, so relax!


### **5.Unemployment/Results/Exams **:

- We know from statistics that most graduates are unable to find a job after they graduate.

- More than 70% of people don't get a job immediately after graduating.

- Students tend to be stressed about exams and results, so they overthink that if they fail their exam, they will fail in life.

- Stress caused by unemployment as well as resultant unemployment. 
- I would say relax, it is just a result and will not affect your life. 
- If you are unemployed, I would suggest you learn new skills which will provide you with excellent opportunities.

### **6.Talk to your Friends/Family who actually care about you**

- According to the case study, talking to family and friends will decrease stress, anxiety, and depression.

- If you talk with your family and friends, you can find a solution to your problems and get rid of stress, anxiety, and depression.

### **7.Distract Yourself**

My suggestion would be to distract yourself while doing things like sleeping, spending time with family, learning new things, and exploring yourself.

### **8.Fix a time to think about Stress:**
The simplest solution is to set aside 5 to 10 minutes each day to consider the stress, anxiety, and depression you experience throughout the day. Then, forget about it.


### **9.Organize everything you need to do that day and work accordingly **

### **10.You should spend 30 minutes a day on yourself instead of wasting your time on social media apps.**
