## Increment and Decrement Operation in JavaScript

Hello Everyone, My name is Surya L. This blog will teach you all about the Increment(++) and Decrement Operation(--) in JavaScript.
## Increment a Number with JavaScript
You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.
For example
```
i++;
//is the equivalent of

i = i + 1;
//Note: The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

let myVar = 87;
myVar++;//You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.
```
## Decrement a Number with JavaScript
You can easily Decrement or Subtract one to a variable with the -- operator.
For example
```
i--;
//is the equivalent of

i = i -1;
//Note: The entire line becomes i--;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

let myVar = 11;
myVar--;//You can decrement or decrease a value of myVar by one with the -- operator.

```
