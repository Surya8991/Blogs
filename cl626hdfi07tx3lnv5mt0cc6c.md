- It is appropriate to say thank you in any kind of relationship, including the one you have with a friend, family member, or even a stranger.
- When someone spends their precious time on you, such as helping you when you are struck or appreciating your work, we should thank them.
- A person feels extremely satisfied and happy when he is thanked for something he has done for you. Additionally, it would motivate him to help others.
## Sorry

When requesting a favor from someone, please is a good word to use.

**Here are some examples:**

Assume that two people go to a restaurant where a group of people are seated and there is only one seat/chair. Based on what they say, let's see who gets the chair.

The first person:
Hello, I'm SURYA. Could you please allow me to sit here since the restaurant is full.

The second person:
Step aside, Mr., and let me take this seat.

Based on what you have heard, what would you do?
Since person1 asked politely if any seats were available, we would select him over person2, as he is polite.
 
## No

Saying No would be the hardest thing to do when a person is asking you something.
Places where you should be say No!

- Say No when you cannot do or complete the work on time.

- Say No when saying yes may cause more damage to you then saying No.

- Say No for wasting your time on unnecessary thing's like gossiping , cussing etc. 

- Obviously say No to Drugs/Alcohol etc.

Few words about the topic from my friend @atapas
- It's OK to say Thank You, Sorry, Please, No. However, none of these should be overused/abused. 
- Thank You => When grateful to someone
- Sorry => After realizing the mistake can affect people beyond me and not going to repeat that(as much as possible)
- Please => When asking someone for a favour (Time, Money, Knowledge) 
- No => When doing something, I'll say sorry to myself later!
